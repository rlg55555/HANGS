# HANGS 🧗

A rock climbing interval trainer for Android. Set your hang time, rest time, and total session duration — then let HANGS keep you honest.

## Features
- **3 independent timers** — ON (hang), OFF (rest), SESSION (total workout)
- **Session = 0** runs indefinitely until you tap STOP
- **Audio cues** — distinct chimes for ON/OFF transitions, 5-second warning beeps, victory fanfare at session end
- **Haptic feedback** on every phase change
- **Session log** — every workout is saved with date, cycles, durations, and actual time
- **Variable durations** — 1 second to 1,000 hours, adjusted via +/− buttons, hold for fast scroll, or type directly

## GitHub Actions
Every push to `main` auto-builds a downloadable APK from the **Actions** tab.
